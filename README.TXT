2. It moves 20px downwads when using the command moveDown.
2.5. When I call makeInvisible twice it does it once and then nothing happens.
6. When I invoke the specified colour in without the quotes it says "cannot find symbol".
9. I chose house I first make all the shapes needed for this 2 square, one triangle, one circle. 
I then move the sun using the prompt "moveUp" on the circle aswell as changing the colour to yellow.
I make square big
I move square left
I make square green
I make triangle wide 155px
I move triangle up
I make square small and black
I wouldnt really change much due to how basic the code is and the fact i cant make all to efficient.
